# Introduction

Alibaba Cloud Function Compute Code Samples and Examples.

This repository exists to help you make better use of Alibaba Cloud's Function Compute. Most of the examples here were adapted by me from existing documentation and blog entries on [alibabacloud.com](https://www.alibabacloud.com).

The code here is licensed under an MIT license. Feel free to reuse and adapt to your needs!

# Structure of this Repository

Each set of example code is held in a subdirectory, for example `url-to-title` holds a toy Python 3 function that takes URLs as input and outputs the contents of the <title> tag on the page pointed to by the input URL.

Most examples will include a README explaining how to set up and use the code.
